ABSTARCT for the Project Fashion MNIST Data

Classifier

In this project, we have built a fashion apparel recognition using the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To train the CNN model,
we have used the Fashion MNIST dataset. After successful training,
the CNN model can predict the name of the class given apparel item
belongs to. This is a multiclass classification problem in which there
are 10 apparel classes the items will be classified.

The fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000
training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28
grayscale images, associated with a label from 10 classes.
So the end goal is to train and test the model using Convolution
neural network
